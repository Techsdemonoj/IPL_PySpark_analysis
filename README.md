## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **comprehensive analysis of IPL matches** from **2008 to 2024** using **PySpark** for big data processing and **Matplotlib** for visualization. The dataset includes details on matches, deliveries, players, venues, and performance statistics.

This project was **self-learned** from YouTube tutorials 📺 and implemented independently with **minimal help from Gork AI** 🤖.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Apache PySpark** 🔥 (for big data processing)
- **Matplotlib** 📊 (for visual representation)
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓 (for code execution & visualization)
- **Pandas** 🐼 (for small-scale data manipulations)
- **SQL (PL/SQL queries)** 🗄 (for relational data insights)

## 📂 Dataset Details
The dataset consists of two key files:

- **matches.csv** → Contains match-level data such as teams, venue, date, and results.
- **deliveries.csv** → Ball-by-ball data including batsmen, bowlers, runs, and wickets.
